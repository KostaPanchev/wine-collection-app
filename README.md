This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).


This is a simple application for managing wine collection. The user has options to create, update and delete wines. The products can be sorted and filtered based on various criteria. Changing the filtersOptions and sortingOptions can be done in [config.js](src/config.js). Even though the application is small it is very modular and the application's state is stored in redux store which helps for future maintenance and adding new features. It also includes error handler, that will display eventual problems with http request or others, it also provides feedback while updating the data(spinner). For styling I used [css modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) which provides encapsulation for css rules.

For database I used a mock server. [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server )



### 1 Install JSON Server

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

### 2 Start JSON Server on port 3004

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
```
